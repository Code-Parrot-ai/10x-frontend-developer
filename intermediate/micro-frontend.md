Have you ever wondered how to create a scalable frontend, especially in large-scale enterprises where various components are intricately interdependent?

In the realm of web development, scaling the frontend is akin to orchestrating a symphony – every element needs to be in perfect harmony. This blog aims to unravel this complex tapestry, offering insights into the evolution from small-scale, monolithic structures to the expansive universe of microservices. 

** And don't miss out on the sequel this Saturday, where we'll dive into a real-world example to illustrate these concepts vividly. **

## Small Scale Frontends 

Imagine building a house with a single blueprint that encompasses everything from the foundation to the roof. In web development, this is what we call a monolithic frontend. It's a unified model where all frontend components – from user interfaces to business logic – are tightly integrated into a single platform. It's like having a single, massive JavaScript file that tries to do everything. Want to tweak the login page? Better be careful not to trip over the code for the shopping cart.
