# Exploring React Server Components: Waku vs Next.js

In the world of web development, React Server Components (RSCs) have emerged as a transformative feature with React 18. These components provide a new way to build dynamic user interfaces, optimizing performance by shifting some of the rendering workload from client to server. Among the frameworks adopting this new feature, Waku and Next.js stand out. In this blog, we will compare these two frameworks to understand their approaches to utilizing React Server Components, their strengths, and when to use each.

## Understanding React Server Components (RSCs)

React Server Components allow UI components to be rendered directly on the server, which differs from traditional React components that render on the client side after the initial page load. This server-side execution offers several benefits:

- **Improved Load Performance:** Since the server handles the rendering, the client has less processing to do, which speeds up the initial page load.
- **Better SEO:** Content rendered on the server is more readily indexed by search engines, potentially boosting search rankings.
- **Simplified Data Fetching:** Direct server access to databases and APIs simplifies data management, avoiding common data-fetching complexities in React.

However, RSCs come with limitations such as the inability to access the DOM or use client-side APIs like `useState` and `useEffect`.

## RSCs in Next.js

Next.js, a robust framework from Vercel, has integrated RSCs from version 13 onwards. It supports RSCs natively with no extra configuration required. Here's a simple example of an RSC in Next.js:

```javascript
import db from "some-db";

async function Legos() {
  const URL = db.connect("some_value");
  const data = await db.query(URL, "SELECT * FROM legos");
  return (
    <>
      <h3>My Legos</h3>
      {data.map((lego) => (
        <div key={lego.id}>
          <h2>{lego.title}</h2>
          <img src={lego.image} />
        </div>
      ))}
    </>
  );
}
```

Next.js offers three rendering modes for RSCs:

- **Static:** Routes are pre-rendered at build time.
- **Dynamic:** Routes are generated at request time.
- **Streaming:** Continuously renders UI updates from server to client.

## RSCs in Waku

Waku is a newer, lighter framework designed specifically for RSCs. It is intended for developers who want a streamlined experience focused on RSC capabilities. Waku simplifies the implementation of RSCs, making every component a server component by default. The framework uses directives like `use client` to specify components that require client-side features.

Hereâ€™s an example of how Waku handles a server component:

```javascript
import db from "some-db";
import { ProductGallery } from "../components/gallery.js";

export const ProductsPage = async () => {
  const products = await db.query("SELECT * FROM products");
  return <ProductGallery products={products} />;
};
```

Waku introduces a small learning curve due to its unique structure and the newness of its approach to RSCs.

## When to Use Waku vs Next.js

Choosing between Waku and Next.js depends on the specific needs of your project:

- **Use Waku if:**
  - Your project heavily relies on RSCs and you prefer a minimalist framework.
  - You are experimenting with new ways to build React applications focusing on server-side capabilities.
- **Use Next.js if:**
  - You require a full-featured framework that goes beyond just RSCs.
  - You need the reliability and support of a large community, extensive documentation, and proven production readiness.
  - Your project demands features like static site generation, API routes, or advanced build optimizations.

## Conclusion

Both Waku and Next.js offer compelling features for using React Server Components, but they cater to different developer needs and project scales. Next.js is suitable for more complex, feature-rich applications, whereas Waku is ideal for developers looking to dive deep into the world of RSCs with a simpler, more focused approach. As RSCs continue to evolve, the landscape of frameworks utilizing this technology will likely expand, offering even more options for developers.

# Introduction to Waku: A Minimalist Framework for React Server Components

Waku is a cutting-edge framework designed specifically to harness the full potential of React Server Components (RSCs). Its primary goal is to provide a simplified, streamlined environment for developers looking to focus exclusively on server-side rendering capabilities within the React ecosystem. In this blog post, we'll explore the special features of Waku, provide code examples, and highlight how it differentiates itself from more established frameworks like Next.js.

## Key Features of Waku

Waku stands out due to its minimalist design and targeted approach to using React Server Components. Here are some of the unique features that define Waku:

### 1. **Server Component-First Approach**

Waku is built from the ground up to support RSCs natively. Unlike other frameworks that may require specific configurations to integrate RSCs, Waku treats every component as a server component by default. This design philosophy ensures that all data fetching and rendering logic runs on the server, reducing the initial load and processing demands on the client.

### 2. **Simplified Data Fetching**

Data fetching in Waku is inherently simplified because it operates directly within the server environment. This allows for direct database queries or API calls without exposing sensitive credentials or logic to the client-side of the application.

#### Code Example:

```javascript
// server component
import db from "some-db";

export const ProductsPage = async () => {
  const products = await db.query("SELECT * FROM products");
  return (
    <ul>
      {products.map((product) => (
        <li key={product.id}>{product.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};
```

### 3. **Use Client Directive**

To integrate client-specific functionalities (like interactions or animations that require browser APIs), Waku uses the `use client` directive. This directive allows developers to explicitly designate which components should run on the client, providing a clear demarcation between server and client components.

#### Code Example:

```javascript
// This component uses the 'use client' directive to specify client-side rendering
import { useClient } from "waku";

const InteractiveMap = useClient(() => {
  // Component logic that requires the DOM or client-side APIs
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Interactive Map</h1>
      {/* Map implementation would go here */}
    </div>
  );
});
```

### 4. **Optimized for Small Projects**

Waku is specifically optimized for smaller projects and development environments. While it's not recommended for large-scale production environments yet, its streamlined nature makes it ideal for rapid prototyping and small-scale applications.

### 5. **Community and Support**

Although newer and smaller in scale compared to Next.js, Waku is fostering a growing community of developers excited about the possibilities of RSCs. Early adopters and contributors are shaping the framework's development and capabilities.

## How Waku Differs from Next.js

While both Waku and Next.js utilize React Server Components, their target use cases and additional features vary significantly:

- **Complexity and Scale:** Next.js is built for full-scale production applications, offering a wide range of features beyond RSCs, such as static site generation (SSG), automatic code splitting, and powerful plugins. Waku, on the other hand, focuses on delivering a pure RSC experience with minimal overhead, making it less suitable for complex applications but ideal for RSC-focused projects.
- **Production Readiness:** Next.js is backed by Vercel and has proven its reliability and scalability in production environments. Waku is still in its early stages and is primarily recommended for development use and smaller projects.
- **Learning Curve:** Waku presents a lower barrier to entry for developers looking solely to work with RSCs, whereas Next.js, with its broader feature set and more complex configuration options, might require a steeper learning curve.

## Conclusion

Waku is an exciting new entrant in the React framework landscape, offering a fresh take on server-side rendering with a focus on React Server Components. Its simplicity and efficiency make it a great tool for developers looking to explore RSCs without the overhead of more comprehensive frameworks like Next.js. As Waku continues to evolve, it promises to become an even more robust option for modern web development.
