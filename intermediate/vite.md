Are you a frontend developer constantly looking for ways to streamline your development process? Have you ever found yourself waiting for what feels like an eternity for your project to compile? Or perhaps you're on the lookout for a tool that seamlessly integrates with frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular, enhancing your development experience. If these challenges sound familiar, then Vite might just be the solution you've been searching for.

### What Exactly is Vite?

Vite (French for "fast", pronounced /veet/) is a modern build tool that significantly improves the frontend development experience. It leverages the power of ES modules to serve your code via native ES Module imports during development, enabling lightning-fast server start-up and hot module replacement (HMR).

Designed to be simple yet powerful, Vite automatically optimizes your project for production, employing rollup under the hood for bundling. This approach not only ensures a quick development cycle but also results in highly optimized and efficient production builds.

### Why Vite?

**Fast Compilation and Hot Module Replacement**

Vite uses native ES modules and modern browser APIs to compile your code on the fly, providing fast build times and instant updates in the browser. This approach eliminates the need for a bundler during development, significantly reducing the time spent on building and deploying your applications. The built-in development server in Vite is optimized for fast reloading and hot module replacement, allowing developers to see changes they make to their code in real-time without the need for a full page refresh.

**Lazy Loading of Modules**

Implementing lazy-loading of modules means that code is only loaded when it is actually needed. This results in smaller bundle sizes and improved performance, especially for larger applications. Lazy loading also ensures faster initial load times for your users, as the code for non-critical parts of your application is only loaded when required.

**Tree-shaking and Code Splitting**

Viteâ€™s optimization techniques, such as tree-shaking and code splitting, help reduce the size of your code and improve performance. Tree-shaking removes unused code from your application, while code splitting divides your code into smaller, more manageable chunks loaded on demand. These features ensure that users only download the code necessary for the current page, resulting in faster load times and improved overall performance.

**Built-in Development Server**

Including a built-in development server, Vite is optimized for fast reloading and hot module replacement. This server facilitates the development and testing of your application, allowing you to see the changes you make to your code in real-time without the need for a full page refresh. It also supports automatic reloading of your code, enabling quick iteration on your changes without manual reloading.

### How Does Vite Enhance Your Development Workflow?

Imagine you're working on a large React project. Each component update traditionally requires the browser to process the entire bundle, leading to slower feedback loops. With Vite, only the changed module is recompiled and updated in the browser. This means you can see your changes almost instantly, dramatically improving your development speed.

Moreover, Vite's development server serves files over native ESM, an approach that is both faster and more efficient than traditional bundling during development. This method also eliminates the need for source map overhead, making debugging quicker and more straightforward.

### Conclusion

Vite represents a significant leap forward in frontend development tools, offering speed, efficiency, and an improved developer experience. Whether you're working with React, Vue, Angular, or even vanilla JavaScript, Vite's simplicity and performance enhancements make it an invaluable tool in your development toolkit.

This ensures that your projects are built using modern, maintainable, and scalable code, reducing the need for future updates and making it easier to maintain your applications over time.

#### Disadvantages of Vite

Despite its many benefits, Vite also has some drawbacks that are worth considering before choosing to use it for your project. Some of the main cons of Vite include the following:

**\*\***Smaller community**\*\***

Vite is a relatively new frontend tool, and as a result, its user community is smaller compared to more established tools such as Create React App or Webpack. This can make it harder to find support or solutions to problems that may arise during development.

**\*\***Limited browser compatibility**\*\***

Vite uses modern JavaScript features that are not yet supported by all browsers. This means that some users may not be able to use your application without updating their browser or using a polyfill.

## The Problems

Before ES modules were available in browsers, developers had no native mechanism for authoring JavaScript in a modularized fashion. This is why we are all familiar with the concept of "bundling": using tools that crawl, process and concatenate our source modules into files that can run in the browser.

Over time we have seen tools like [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) and [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), which greatly improved the development experience for frontend developers.

However, as we build more and more ambitious applications, the amount of JavaScript we are dealing with is also increasing dramatically. It is not uncommon for large scale projects to contain thousands of modules. We are starting to hit a performance bottleneck for JavaScript based tooling: it can often take an unreasonably long wait (sometimes up to minutes!) to spin up a dev server, and even with Hot Module Replacement (HMR), file edits can take a couple of seconds to be reflected in the browser. The slow feedback loop can greatly affect developers' productivity and happiness.

Vite aims to address these issues by leveraging new advancements in the ecosystem: the availability of native ES modules in the browser, and the rise of JavaScript tools written in compile-to-native languages.

### Slow Server Start

When cold-starting the dev server, a bundler-based build setup has to eagerly crawl and build your entire application before it can be served.

Vite improves the dev server start time by first dividing the modules in an application into two categories: **dependencies** and **source code**.

- **Dependencies** are mostly plain JavaScript that do not change often during development. Some large dependencies (e.g. component libraries with hundreds of modules) are also quite expensive to process. Dependencies may also be shipped in various module formats (e.g. ESM or CommonJS).

  Vite [pre-bundles dependencies](https://vitejs.dev/dep-pre-bundling.html) using [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/). esbuild is written in Go and pre-bundles dependencies 10-100x faster than JavaScript-based bundlers.

- **Source code** often contains non-plain JavaScript that needs transforming (e.g. JSX, CSS or Vue/Svelte components), and will be edited very often. Also, not all source code needs to be loaded at the same time (e.g. with route-based code-splitting).

  Vite serves source code over [native ESM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules). This is essentially letting the browser take over part of the job of a bundler: Vite only needs to transform and serve source code on demand, as the browser requests it. Code behind conditional dynamic imports is only processed if actually used on the current screen.

### Slow Updates

When a file is edited in a bundler-based build setup, it is inefficient to rebuild the whole bundle for an obvious reason: the update speed will degrade linearly with the size of the app.

In some bundlers, the dev server runs the bundling in memory so that it only needs to invalidate part of its module graph when a file changes, but it still needs to re-construct the entire bundle and reload the web page. Reconstructing the bundle can be expensive, and reloading the page blows away the current state of the application. This is why some bundlers support Hot Module Replacement (HMR): allowing a module to "hot replace" itself without affecting the rest of the page. This greatly improves DX - however, in practice we've found that even HMR update speed deteriorates significantly as the size of the application grows.

In Vite, HMR is performed over native ESM. When a file is edited, Vite only needs to precisely invalidate the chain between the edited module and its closest HMR boundary (most of the time only the module itself), making HMR updates consistently fast regardless of the size of your application.

Vite also leverages HTTP headers to speed up full page reloads (again, let the browser do more work for us): source code module requests are made conditional via `304 Not Modified`, and dependency module requests are strongly cached via `Cache-Control: max-age=31536000,immutable` so they don't hit the server again once cached.

Once you experience how fast Vite is, we highly doubt you'd be willing to put up with bundled development again.

## Why Bundle for Production

Even though native ESM is now widely supported, shipping unbundled ESM in production is still inefficient (even with HTTP/2) due to the additional network round trips caused by nested imports. To get the optimal loading performance in production, it is still better to bundle your code with tree-shaking, lazy-loading and common chunk splitting (for better caching).

Ensuring optimal output and behavioral consistency between the dev server and the production build isn't easy. This is why Vite ships with a pre-configured [build command](https://vitejs.dev/build.html)that bakes in many [performance optimizations](https://vitejs.dev/features.html#build-optimizations) out of the box.

## Why Not Bundle with esbuild?

Vite's current plugin API isn't compatible with using `esbuild` as a bundler. In spite of `esbuild` being faster, Vite's adoption of Rollup's flexible plugin API and infrastructure heavily contributed to its success in the ecosystem. For the time being, we believe that Rollup offers a better performance-vs-flexibility tradeoff.

Rollup has also been working on performance improvements, [switching its parser to SWC in v4](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5073). And there is an ongoing effort to build a Rust-port of Rollup called Rolldown. Once Rolldown is ready, it could replace both Rollup and esbuild in Vite, improving build performance significantly and removing inconsistencies between development and build.
