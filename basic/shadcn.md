#### What is shadcn? ðŸ¤”

[Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) stands out among the many UI frameworks and libraries as a helpful resource for developers looking for an open-source, customizable way to create stunning and useful user interfaces. Shadcn is a tool to help you build your component library. These are components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

It's not a component library, which means you do not install it as a dependency from a package manager such as npm. Shadcn provides beautiful UI components which can be directly added into your app as code and you can customize it all you want.

#### How to install shadcn in a React project?

Start by creating a new React project using `vite`:

```bash
npm create vite@latest shadcn-app -- --template react-ts
```

or if you're using yarn:
```bash
yarn create vite shadcn-app --template react-ts
```

Now enter into the app by running:
```bash
cd shadcn-app
```
Install all the dependencies by running:
```bash
npm install
```

or if you're using yarn:
```bash
yarn
```
Install `tailwindcss` and it's dependencies, then generate your `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` files:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer

npx tailwindcss init -p
```

or if you're using yarn:
```bash
yarn add -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer

npx tailwindcss init -p
```
Edit the `tsconfig.json` file

```javascript
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": [
        "./src/*"
      ]
    }
    // ...
  }
}
```

Now run the following so you can import "path" without error:
```bash
npm i -D @types/node
```

Add the following to `vite.config.ts` so your app can resolve paths without error:
```javascript
import path from "path"
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react"
import { defineConfig } from "vite"

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      "@": path.resolve(__dirname, "./src"),
    },
  },
})
```

Now run the shadcn-ui init command to setup the project:
```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

or if you're using yarn:
```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

After running this you'll be prompted with a few questions, you can answer them according to your preferences or following along with me as shown:

That's it! Now we're set to add `shadcn` components to our app in a breeze! ðŸŽ‰

There is a massive list of components we can add that shadcn provides us, you can find the list [here](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/accordion). Starting from Accordion all the way to tooltips we have almost all components used in projects with a great design. 

In this article, I am going to show you how to add a button as well as an alert dialog component using `shadcn`. You can try adding other components as well!

To add a button component let's run:
```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
```

or if you're using yarn:
```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
```

To add the alert dialog component run:
```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add alert-dialog
```

of if you're using yarn:
```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add alert-dialog
```

Change the `App.tsx` to this:

```typescript
import { useState } from "react";
import "./App.css";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import {
  AlertDialog,
  AlertDialogAction,
  AlertDialogCancel,
  AlertDialogContent,
  AlertDialogDescription,
  AlertDialogFooter,
  AlertDialogHeader,
  AlertDialogTitle,
  AlertDialogTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/alert-dialog";

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Vite + React</h1>
      <div className="card">
        <Button onClick={() => setCount((count) => count + 1)}>
          Button Component to set count: {count}
        </Button>
      </div>
      <AlertDialog>
        <AlertDialogTrigger><Button>Open Dialog</Button></AlertDialogTrigger>
        <AlertDialogContent>
          <AlertDialogHeader>
            <AlertDialogTitle>Something here?</AlertDialogTitle>
            <AlertDialogDescription>
              This action cannot be undone. This action is harmful.
            </AlertDialogDescription>
          </AlertDialogHeader>
          <AlertDialogFooter>
            <AlertDialogCancel>Cancel</AlertDialogCancel>
            <AlertDialogAction>Continue</AlertDialogAction>
          </AlertDialogFooter>
        </AlertDialogContent>
      </AlertDialog>
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
```

You should see something like this:
![App preview](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1710944560132/IflX_m4dU.png?auto=format)

Here we're using a shadcn button to control the alert, as well as using the button to increase the `count` state.

#### Support with other frameworks:

Other than React, shadcn is also supported on multiple other frameworks including Next.js and Astro among many others. You can find more [here](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation).

[Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) also has various themes, and color customizations to better meet your design needs. It's a really intuitive and developer friendly tool which you should start using today if you're already not!
